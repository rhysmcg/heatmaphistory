Mapping Location using Google Fusion Tables (Heatmap and Points). I previously used Google Fusion Tables and it automatically generated heatmaps but it was announced to be discontinued from December 2019. I decided to convert the coordinates over to the  Google Maps API using the Heatmap Tutorial.

This is what the Fusion Table Map looked like.

This is my imitation using Google Maps API in order to preserve it.
